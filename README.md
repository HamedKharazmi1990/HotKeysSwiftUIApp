# HotKeys App (SwiftUI) ⌨️✨

A cross-platform SwiftUI app (iPhone, iPad, and Mac) focused on keyboard shortcuts / hotkeys and productivity-style interactions.  
This repository is primarily a **portfolio project** where I collect and showcase my Swift / SwiftUI code samples.

> ✅ Purpose: Provide clean, reviewable code samples for job applications.

## Platforms

- iOS (iPhone)
- iPadOS (iPad)
- macOS (Mac)

> Note: “Global hotkeys” are most relevant on macOS. iOS/iPadOS support is implemented where the OS allows it.

## Highlights

- SwiftUI-first UI
- Reusable components & clean architecture (in progress)
- Focus on practical patterns and code quality

---

## Tech Stack
